# UserPromptSubmit: the session-length nudge. CLAUDE.md says to prefer several
# short sessions chained through memory over one long one, and nothing
# enforces it — a token audit of the framework's own sessions found the two
# largest ran 400+ turns at ~267k tokens of context each and never cleared, a
# fifth of all cache-read between them. Cache-read is 91% main-thread and scales with
# context × turns, so the cheapest token is the one a fresh session never
# carries. This hook says so, once, when the context is large enough for it
# to matter, and again only when it has grown by a further step.
#
# The number is exact, not a proxy: the transcript's last assistant line
# carries the API's `usage` for that turn, and input + cache_read +
# cache_creation is the context that turn was served with. Reading it costs a
# `tail -c` of the file's last 128 kB, no full parse — a session's transcript
# runs to tens of MB. When no usage line is in reach the file size stands in,
# at the bytes-per-token ratio measured across this repo's own transcripts.
#
# Once-gating lives in a temp-dir marker holding the last level nudged at,
# keyed by session id AND transcript path: a resumed session keeps both and
# stays quiet until the next step; a /clear gets a new transcript and starts
# over. Same safety rule as every hook here: wrapped in try, exit 0 — a bug
# costs a missing nudge, never a broken prompt.
