# PostToolUse(Bash): the nudge that needs to see the command that just ran —
# a Bash call that reached for python, sed or grep where the house tool is nu
# or ast-grep. CLAUDE.md says this already, in a file loaded every session —
# and the framework's own transcripts showed it losing to habit on 18% of
# Bash calls. That is the gap a hook closes: it fires only when the anti-pattern
# actually appears, which is the conditional-rule case hooks exist for, rather
# than spending prompt on a rule that is usually irrelevant.
#
# The `git push` checkpoint nudge used to live here too. It is the agmem
# plugin's now (`agmem hook post-tool-use`), along with the other memory
# seams, so a project without this framework gets it as well.
#
# Two rules govern the text, both learned from the hook reference:
#
# - Factual, never imperative. Text framed as an out-of-band instruction trips
#   Claude's prompt-injection defences, and gets surfaced to the user as
#   suspicious rather than read as context.
# - Once per session per nudge. Repetition is what gets a hook switched off, and
#   the second copy of a landed point is pure noise. This one self-extinguishes:
#   the better the habit gets, the less it fires.
#
# Nothing here can block a tool call. PostToolUse runs after the command has
# already succeeded, and this returns additionalContext on exit 0 — no decision,
# no exit 2, so a bug in this file costs a missing nudge and nothing else.
