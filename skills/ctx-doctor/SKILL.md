description: Check that ctx-flow's dependencies are installed and wired — nu (and its MCP server), agmem (binary and plugin), ast-grep, plus whatever /ctx-onboard added — and that ast-grep parses this project. Prints the exact fix for anything broken.

# ctx-doctor

Run the deterministic checks first and use their output as the report's spine:

```bash
nu "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.claude/scripts/doctor.nu"
```

It prints two tables: dependency status with a fix hint per missing row
(the seed's three — nu, agmem, ast-grep — plus any `EXTRA_DEPS` rows
`/ctx-onboard` added), and the project's top source extensions with which
ast-grep grammar handles each — built in, `buildable →`, `unregistered →`,
or `no grammar`.

Then add the four checks a script cannot do well:

1. **nu MCP server registered?** You can tell from your own tool list: if
   `mcp__nu__evaluate` is available in this session, it is registered and
   working. If not, the fix is `claude mcp add nu -- nu --mcp` (add
   `--scope project` to keep it per-repo).
2. **agmem plugin live?** Same test, two parts. An `agmem:checkpoint` skill
   in your skill list means the plugin is installed; an agmem `context` tool
   (`mcp__plugin_agmem_agmem__context`) means the server is up. Tools without
   the skill is a hand registration and no plugin: the fix is
   `claude plugin marketplace add AlfoldiMate/agmem` then
   `claude plugin install agmem@agmem`, and `claude mcp remove agmem -s user`
   for the hand one (Claude Code connects only one, and the hand one renames
   the tools to `mcp__agmem__*`, which this framework's agents do not name).
   Skill without tools means the plugin's server failed to start —
   `agmem --doctor` says why. An `OLD` binary row means the plugin's hooks are
   silent; a `STALE` row means no space derivation, so every project reads
   and writes one shared `default` space.
3. **Hooks live?** Confirm `.claude/settings.json` registers the
   UserPromptSubmit (context nudge), PreToolUse (read guard on Bash and Read)
   and PostToolUse (idiom nudge) hooks and that the nu scripts exist at the
   paths it names. The memory hooks — briefing, seams, recall log — are the
   plugin's; a second `agmem context` in settings would brief twice. If
   `.claude` is a symlink, resolve it and confirm the target exists — a
   dangling symlink is the silent failure mode. `nu .claude/hooks/tests/<name>.nu`
   runs a hook's cases when one looks wrong.
4. **ast-grep actually parses the main language.** Take the top extension
   from the second table, pick one file of it, and run a trivial pattern:
   `ast-grep run -p '$A' -l <lang> <file> | head -3`. A grammar listed is not
   a grammar that loads, and a pattern with a metavariable is the sharper
   test, since a language whose syntax uses `$` needs an `expandoChar`.
   Rows reading `buildable →`, `unregistered →` or `registered, unbuilt →`
   carry their own fix, which is `/ctx-grammar <lang>`; offer it.
   `no grammar` means only that this framework's registry has no entry —
   `/ctx-grammar` can still try; the genuine dead end is a language with no
   tree-sitter grammar at all, where the fallback is `rg` plus the editor's LSP.

## Report

One line per dependency: ok, or the exact command to run. Lead with what is
broken; if everything passes, say so in two lines and stop. Do not install
anything yourself — the fixes touch global state, so present them for the
user to run. `/ctx-grammar` is the exception: it writes only to
`~/.cache/ctx-flow` and the project's `sgconfig.yml`, so run it once the
user agrees.
