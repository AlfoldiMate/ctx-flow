# ctx-checkpoint

Store memory so that a fresh session — with none of this context — could pick
the work up without asking a single question. The ritual itself ships with
agmem's Claude Code plugin; this skill runs it and adds the one step that is
this framework's own.

## 1. The ritual

Invoke the **`agmem:checkpoint`** skill, passing `$ARGUMENTS` through. It
carries the measured order — distil, `recall` before every write so a
correction lands as `supersedes`, `remember` in one batch, `reflect` with
`derived_from` for a conclusion drawn from stored claims, branch state as
fast-decay facts under the branch tag — and reports what it stored.

If no `agmem:checkpoint` skill exists in this session, the plugin is not
installed: say so, point at `/ctx-doctor` for the fix, and stop. Do not
improvise the ritual from memory — its wording is the measured part.

## 2. Gate proposed learnings

Subagents may end a response with `LEARNED: <claim> — <evidence>`. Those are
**proposals**. This is where they are accepted or dropped — that separation
is deliberate: the agent proposing a rule is often the cheapest, least
informed thing in the system, and rules it writes bind every future run.

Collect them from two places: the replies still in context, and this
branch's **documents** — an agent that wrote one closed it with the same
line, and that copy survives compaction. List them with the branch tag the
plugin announced at session start (or
`nu "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.claude/hooks/scripts/ctx-paths.nu" --tag`):

```bash
agmem doc list --tag branch:<slug>
agmem doc get <id> --raw | rg '^LEARNED:'      # per document written this session
```

Keep the documents in the shell; only the proposal lines reach the thread.
The `agent:<name>` tag on a document names the role a proposal belongs to.

For each proposal, apply all four tests. Store it only if it passes all of
them:

1. **Durable** — true of this project, not of this task.
2. **Non-obvious** — not something the repo, a type, or a test already says.
3. **Earned** — seen more than once, or once at real cost. A single cheap
   surprise is an anecdote.
4. **Actionable** — it changes what a future run would *do*. "The parser is
   complex" changes nothing.

An accepted proposal becomes a `lesson` tagged `role:<agent>`, with the
evidence in the claim itself ("… — proved by the retry-path deadlock on
2026-08-30"), because a rule whose reason is invisible cannot be pruned
honestly later. One that came out of a document is stored with `reflect`,
not `remember`, with `derived_from: ["episode:<doc id>"]` — the lesson then
cites the report it was earned in, and `inspect` can open it. A proposal
that binds *every* session, not just one role, becomes an `instruction` —
rare, and worth a second look before pinning.

Before storing, `recall` with the same `role:` tag: if an existing rule
contradicts the new one, resolve it now with `supersedes` — two opposing
rules are worse than neither.

**Dropping a proposal is the common outcome and needs no justification.** Say
how many you saw (and how many of those came from documents) and how many
you kept, and move on.

## Then

One line on top of the ritual's report: proposals seen vs kept. Then tell the
user they can safely `/clear` — better than letting auto-compaction fire,
because the memory is now in the store and the plugin's SessionStart hook
puts it in front of the next session.
