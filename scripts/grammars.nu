# What ast-grep can do with this project's languages — the one module that knows.
#
# ast-grep bundles a fixed set of grammars and loads anything else from a
# dynamic library. So "no grammar" was reporting a missing *binary* as a missing
# *capability*: for most tree-sitter languages it is one build away, not a dead
# end. Both halves read this file — build-grammar.nu compiles and registers,
# doctor.nu reports — because a second copy of any of it would drift, and the
# drift is silent: doctor claiming "built" for a language sgconfig.yml never
# registered, and every pattern failing as unsupported.

# --- what ast-grep already handles ---------------------------------------

# BUILT-IN grammars, keyed by file extension. Absent here does not mean absent
# from ast-grep — see CUSTOM_GRAMMARS for the ones this framework can compile.

# `expando` is load-bearing, not decoration. ast-grep parses the *pattern* with
# the target grammar, so `$VAR` has to be valid syntax in that language. In nu
# `$` is the variable sigil: `def $N [$$$P] { }` is a parse error, and every
# metavariable pattern dies with "Multiple AST nodes are detected". expandoChar
# swaps `$` for a character the grammar accepts as a plain identifier, and
# ast-grep maps it back after matching.
#
# `subdir` is optional and only matters for monorepo grammars that keep
# grammar.js one level down (tree-sitter-typescript ships typescript/ and tsx/).
