# Store stdin as an agmem document and print its address — the one way a
# subagent hands back anything longer than its return contract.
#
# Why a wrapper and not `agmem doc put` inline: the document must carry the
# same `branch:<slug>` tag the SessionStart hook announces and /ctx-checkpoint
# writes, so `agmem doc list --tag branch:<slug>` is "this branch's
# documents". That slug has one rule, in `_common.nu`; an agent substituting
# it by hand drifts, and on a detached HEAD an empty expansion becomes
# `--tag ""`. The wrapper resolves the tag through `paths`, adds
# `agent:<name>` so /ctx-checkpoint knows which role's playbook a proposal joins,
# and refuses loudly where the raw CLI would fail quietly: a binary without
# `agmem doc`, an empty document, one over the store's size cap.
#
# Usage, content on stdin:
#     nu .claude/scripts/doc-put.nu <agent> <kind> <title> [--mime text/plain]
# Prints `<id> memory://<space>/doc/<id>` — return it as `DOC: <id> <uri>`.
